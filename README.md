# Bike Sharing

**Overview of the analysis:** 

Bike-sharing systems have recently gained popularity, despite decades of legislative pushes for more accessible transportation. Citibikes are one of the first companies to provide rental bikes with multiple docking stations; making it easier for the user to return the bike at the end of their trip. Because of the growing popularity many companies are looking to Citibike as a template to establish bike-sharing systems in more cities. Analyzing user data will help start-up companies develop their own system successfully. 



**Results:**

One of the first things we analyzed was the checkout times by user. This gave use an understanding of how long most bikers use the bikes.

To further analyze the checkout times by gender. This gave us a clearer understanding of who uses the bikes and for how long.

Trips by weekday per hour give us a clearer understanding of the peak hours during the weekday that people are using the Citibikes.

Similar to the previous chart, we are comparing gender by usage by using a heatmap.

Citibike has two different users: customers and subscribers. The customer user type only uses the bike once why the Subscriber is a frequent user. We are comparing the different usage patterns of these two groups.

Another graph comparing usage by gender. Hovering over the pie chart provides further details.

We use this bar chart to further understand peak rental hours.

**Summary:**

Several of our charts comparing gender reveal that men use citi bikes more often than women. The peak hours of usage are between 6-8 pm. Surprisingly the bikes are more frequently rented during the weekday compared to the weekend and subscribers use the bikes more than single-day users. This can conclude that these bikes are more frequently used as transportation to and from work. Peak hours are from 8-9 am and again at 6-8 pm. A qualitative study should be conducted to further prove this hypothesis.
